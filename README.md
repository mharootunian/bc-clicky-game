##Clicky Game

###How to play
When the game loads, you will see 12 images on the screen. Click on any image to gain 1 point. Everytime you click an image, all the images on the page
will shuffle around. This is a memory game so remember what images you have clicked! 

If you click the same image twice in one round, you lose and must start over.
